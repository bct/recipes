Cook time: 25 min
Yield: 4 servings

## Quickie Green Chile Sauce: ##

- 1 cup light vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon arrowroot starch dissolved in a little cold water
- 1 generous cup chopped roasted green chiles- hot or mild
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon cumin or chili powder, hot or mild, to taste

## For the filling: ##

- 1 15-oz can organic black beans, rinsed, drained
- 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
- Fresh lime juice from 1 big juicy lime
- 2 heaping cups cooked sweet potatoes, smashed a bit, but still chunky [I cube mine, then soften just a little]
- 1/2 cup chopped roasted green chiles
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, or curry, mild or spicy, as you prefer
- Sea salt and black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

## To Assemble: ##

2-4 tablespoons light olive oil or vegetable oil, as needed
8 white corn tortillas
Shredded Monterey Jack cheese, or vegan cheese, if desired


Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Choose a baking dish that would hold 8 enchiladas.

Make your Quickie Green Chile Sauce by combining the broth, dissolved arrowroot, green chiles, garlic and spices in a sauce pan and heating over medium-high heat. Bring to a high simmer. Simmer until thickened. Taste test. Set aside.

In the meantime, using a mixing bowl, combine the drained black beans with minced garlic and lime juice. Toss to coat the beans and set aside.

In a separate bowl combine the lightly smashed sweet potatoes with the chopped green chiles; add the spices. Season with sea salt and pepper.


Pour about 1/4 cup of the Quickie Green Chile Sauce into the bottom of the baking dish.

Grab a skillet and heat a dash of oil. Lightly cook the corn tortillas to soften them - one at a time - as you stuff each one.

## How do I stuff thee? ##

Lay the first hot tortilla in the sauced baking dish; wet it with the sauce.

Spoon 1/8 of the sweet potato mixture down the center.

Top with 1/8 of the black beans.

Wrap and roll the tortilla to the end of the baking dish.

Repeat for the remaining tortillas. Top with the rest of the sauce.

If you like, top with a sprinkle of shredded Monterey Jack cheese or vegan cheese.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the enchiladas are piping hot and the sauce is bubbling around the edges.

Serve with a crisp salad of baby greens and herbs spiked with oranges, strawberries, watermelon or halved grapes. For quick and easy salad dressing recipes see Three Ways to Dress a Naked Salad.
